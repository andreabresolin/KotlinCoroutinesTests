# Kotlin Coroutines Tests

Simple tests to check the performance of [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html) in Android.

The main purpose of this project is to test:

- execution time
- CPU usage
- memory usage

CPU and memory usage can be tested with the help of the [Android Profiler](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/index.html) in Android Studio.
